The game is played using twelve black and twelve white cards numbered from 0 to 11 on one side. 
for example, black card: *1* white card: 
Initially all the cards are laid face down on the table.
Both the player and the computer choose three cards randomly£¬
and then arranges them in growing order with the smallest number on the left to make the code. 
If the code contains the same number twice, the black card is always considered as smaller than the white one. 
The player get a new card randomly from the remaining cards,
looking at it and proposing a value for one of the hidden cards in the computer code.
If the proposed value is not correct, the player must reveal the card 
and insert it at the correct place within his own code giving consequently information about the code.
If the proposed value was correct the computer must reveal the matching card in his code,and 
the player decides go on proposing values for hidden computer's cards until player either guesses incorrecttly or decides to stop.
When the player decides to stop, 
inserts the drawn card without revealing it at the correct place in the code making consequently the code longer. 
Then the computer will repeat the player's action.A player loses the game once the code is completely revealed.
